## Agentina National Fuel Prices


### Project Description

The Argentina National Fuel Market Analysis project aims to provide an in-depth evaluation of the fuel market dynamics within Argentina, focusing on pricing trends, regional disparities, market concentration, and consumer demand. By analyzing key metrics such as fuel prices across different regions, sales revenue by top companies, and the demand for various fuel types, the project seeks to identify patterns and provide actionable insights that can inform business strategies and policy decisions.


### Objectives:
1. Assess Regional Price Differences: Analyze the variability in fuel prices across different regions and cities in Argentina, with a particular focus on identifying factors contributing to higher prices in certain areas like Neuquen, Patagonia.
2. Evaluate Market Concentration: Examine the concentration of market revenue among top fuel companies, assessing the implications of this dominance on competition, pricing, and market dynamics.
3. Understand Consumer Demand: Identify the most popular fuel products, such as Gasoil Grade 3, and assess the factors driving consumer preferences and demand.
4. Monitor Price Fluctuations and Profitability: Track the monthly fluctuations in fuel prices and company profitability to understand seasonal trends and economic impacts.
5. Provide Strategic Recommendations

### Reports
1. The visuals show significant regional price variability. For example, the average price of compressed natural gas (CNG) varies by region, with some regions like "CENTRO" and "NOA" having higher prices compared to others like "PAMPEA" and "PATAGONIA."
Also, it was observed that Neuquen in Patagonia has a notably high price for petrol, indicating 
 that some regions face higher fuel costs possibly due to logistical challenges or regional demand.
2. The fuel market revenue is concentrated among a few major companies, with YPF leading by a significant margin.
3. The average price of compressed natural gas varies across regions, with no region having a significantly lower or higher price, indicating a relatively stable pricing structure for CNG.
4. The analysis shows that Gasoil Grade 3 as the product with the highest sales, indicating strong consumer demand for this fuel type.
5. There is a sharp increase in product prices is observed toward the end of the year


### Recommendations
- The causes of high regional prics , particularly in patagonia should be investigated and addressed.
- New and smaller companies should be encouraged to expand their market share so as to reduce dominance of major companies like YPF, which could lead to more competitive pricing and better options for consumers
